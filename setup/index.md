## Getting Setup

The exercises here are designed to be run on a remote server (you may be able to run them locally on a UNIX machine, but details will vary).

All students should have login access to `rhyolite.bx.mathcs.emory.edu` using your Emory netid as your username.

Before logging in, you will want to set your default shell to something reasonable (bash) rather than the ancient default (ksh). 

To do this, login to [ENID](https://enid.emory.edu/idm/user/login.jsp). Then, click on "Select UNIX/Linux Login Shell". If your shell is not already "/bin/bash", select that option and save.

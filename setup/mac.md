## Getting Setup on a Mac

You should be able to do almost everything locally on your Mac, but you need to install some developer tools that are not avaialble out of the box. 

First, install [XCode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835) from the Mac App Store. 

Once you install Xcode from the App Store, the Command Line Tools are now an optional installation. Youâ€™ll need to enable them under Preferences > Downloads.

Next install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh)

If you follow the directions at the bottom of that page (run the command as a user, not as root), you should now be able to easily install additional tools. For example:

  brew install git
  brew install wget

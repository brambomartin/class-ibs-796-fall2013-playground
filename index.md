## IBS 576: Basic Programming for Bioinformatics

### Fall 2013, Emory University

This is an applied course in computation for Bioinformatics. We will cover the UNIX environment and philosophy, including using the shell and command line tools effectively. We will learn about using version control effectively to both for provenance of our own work and for working collaboratively. We will cover good programming practices such as automated builds and testing. We will learn to program in Python, and learn good design principles of both functional and object oriented programming. We will learn to store and query data in databases. We will learn efficient approaches to work with large amounts of numerical data. Finally, we will apply these skills in a collaborative data intensive bioinformatics project.
